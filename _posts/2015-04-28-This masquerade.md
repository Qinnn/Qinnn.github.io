This Masquerade

Are we really happy with this lonely game we play,

Looking for the right words to say?

Searching but not finding understanding anyway,

We're lost in this masquerade.

Both afraid to say we're just too far away

From being close together from the start.

We try to talk it over, but the words got in the way

We're lost inside this lonely game we play.

Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes,

And no matter how hard I try

To understand the reason why we carry on this way

We're lost in this masquerade.

To understand the reason why we carry on this way

We're lost in this masquerade.

We're lost in a masquerade.
 
And we're lost in a masquerade.

Some music from movies can be quite impressive. This masquerade is from [L'amant](http://movie.douban.com/subject/1291868/), a good movie adapted from Marguerite Duras' book [L'amant](http://book.douban.com/subject/1400705/). This piece of music should be enjoyed together with some pale yellow sunshine in the twilight.
