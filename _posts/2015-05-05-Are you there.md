Are you really there
---------------------

Are you really here

or am I dreaming

I can’t tell dreams from truth

For it’s been so long

since I have seen you

I can hardly remember you face anymore

When I get really lonely

and the distance calls its only silence

I think of you smiling

with pride in your eyes a lover that sighs

If you want me

satisfy me

If you want me

satisfy me

Are you really sure

that you believe me

When others say I lie

I wonder if you could

ever despise me

When you know I really try

To be a better one

to satisfy you

for you're everything to me

And I do

what you ask me

If you let me be free

If you want me

satisfy me

If you want me

satisfy me

If you want me

satisfy me

If you want me

satisfy me
